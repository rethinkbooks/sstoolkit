 @brief This class pushes UIWebView to its limits and many common

 forwards all of UIWebView's public methods to an internal instance. It has
 been designed to be a drop in replacement for UIWebView.
 
 Things of interest are the SSWebView properties and the extra delegate methods.

 executes for more than 10 seconds, the web view stops executing the script. This is likely to occur
 at a random place in your code, so unintended consequences may result. This limit is imposed because
 JavaScript execution may cause the main thread to block, so when scripts are running, the user is not
 able to interact with the webpage.

 limit on the total memory allocation for JavaScript.
